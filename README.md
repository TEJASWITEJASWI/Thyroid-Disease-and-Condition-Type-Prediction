# Thyroid-Disease-and-Condition-Type-Prediction

# ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict various thyroid conditions based on user input. It aims to help users understand their thyroid health through a simple web interface.

# ðŸ”§ How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

Model Development: Several machine learning algorithms were tested to find the best model for prediction.

User Interface: A Streamlit web application allows users to input their health parameters and receive predictions about thyroid conditions.

Visualizations: Data visualizations provide insights into the results and model performance.

# ðŸ’» Skills Used
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Developed and evaluated predictive models
